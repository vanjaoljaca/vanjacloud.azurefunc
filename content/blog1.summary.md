# Hello World: A New Blog UX
No one reads blog posts, they're too long with too much filler. What if they just gave you the key insights up-front?

This is my proof of concept for a new blog UX. I give you a one-pager summary of the idea in a way that aims to inspire you into action, and on the right is the pull mechanism for the details.

What kind of details? I kept a detailed log of every thought I had while building this, including the implementation steps. The data is served via ChatGPT. Maybe you'll identify insights and process improvements via prompting.

I did this to jump-start my personal AI/UX exploration journey. I quit(ing) my job to focus on experimentation and the social aspect of techology.

My main contact point for the journey is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vanjaoljaca). I'll be posting details here, and I'll be branching out to video soon.

To implement this idea for yourself:
1. Keep a markdown file open while you work on your project. Write down every thing that comes to mind, any plans, any successes, any failures.
2. At the end, create a TIGHT 1 page summary. Delete all unnecessary words.
3. Post to your blog, and host a [ChatGPT window](https://github.com/vanjaoljaca/vanjacloud.web/blob/main/src/App.tsx) next to it. This is the [system prompt](https://github.com/vanjaoljaca/vanjacloudjs/blob/main/content/systemprompt.template.md) I use.
